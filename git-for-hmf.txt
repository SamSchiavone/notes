Setup:
1) Go to other person's github webpage
2) Fork the repository you'd like to edit to copy it to your (online) github account
3) Click the clone button (SSH!) and copy command
4) Navigate where you'd like to put it in Terminal and type git clone and paste the link
5) You did it!

Further notes:
git remote -v # tells you where things are fetched from and pushed to on the web

To communicate with the upstream version (the repo you forked from) need to "add upstream", e.g.,
git remote add upstream git@github.com:edgarcosta/hilbertmodularforms.git
Then if you do "git remote -v" it should include more options for fetching and pushing.

Workflow:
1) git add filename (add the file to be tracked)
2) git commit -m "message" (commit to the change on my local machine)
3) git push (this pushes to my cloud)
4) go to Edgar's webpage and make a pull request (this makes the changes on Edgar's cloud)
5) To get changes from Edgar's cloud (if other people have done work that has been merged): git pull upstream master

Branches:
To make a new branch (starting from upstream/master)
git fetch upstream
git checkout upstream/master
git checkout -b new_branch_name
